/ Kubernetes Operator: A software extension that uses custom resources to manage applications and their components.
/ CRD (Custom Resource Definition): A way to extend the Kubernetes API to create your own custom resources.
/ Rollout: The process of updating the instances of an application in a controlled manner.
/ ServiceAccount: An identity for processes that run in a Pod.
/ PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): A request for storage by a user.
/ Secret: An object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.
/ Deployment: Provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.
/ Service: A networking Layer 3/4 load balancer that exposes the pods within the Kubernetes cluster.
/ Ingress: Similar to a Reverse Proxy, it exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
/ HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales the number of pods in a deployment based on observed CPU utilization.
/ CronJob: Creates Jobs on a repeating schedule.
/ YAML: A human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages and is often used to write configuration files.
/ Blueprint: A template for creating new deployments based on predefined configurations.
/ Rollback: The action of reverting to a previous state of the deployment configuration.
/ CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment): Practices that aim to improve software delivery using automated testing and deployment.
/ IaC (Infrastructure as Code): Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
/ PaaS (Platform as a Service): A category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.
/ SaaS (Software as a Service): A software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a service provider and made available to customers over the internet.
/ Namespace: A way to divide cluster resources between multiple users in Kubernetes.
/ Millicores: A unit of CPU measurement in Kubernetes, where 1000 millicores equals 1 CPU core.
/ One-Click Deployment: A system designed to simplify Kubernetes deployments by providing a user-friendly interface and automating complex tasks.
/ Open-Source Software (OSS): Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
/ Container Orchestration: Automated management of containerized applications across multiple clusters, typically using tools like Kubernetes.
/ Minikube: A tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally.
/ Docker: A platform used to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers.
/ Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
/ SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): A standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client.
/ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): A method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise.
/ Network Policies: Specifications that define how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
