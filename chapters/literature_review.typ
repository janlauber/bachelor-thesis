= Analysis of the Current Landscape and Challenges

This chapter analyzes the current landscape of OSS deployment, highlighting key technologies in use, prevalent challenges, and gaps that the One-Click Deployment system seeks to address. The analysis and insights are derived from *Project 2*, also conducted at the University of Applied Sciences at Bern by Jan Lauber @lauberProjectOneClickDeployment2024.

== Overview of Open-Source Software & Deployment

OSS refers to software that is distributed with its source code, allowing users to view, modify, and distribute it freely. OSS has gained significant popularity due to its collaborative development model, transparency, and cost-effectiveness. Many OSS projects have emerged as critical components of modern software systems, powering applications, infrastructure, and services across various industries. The deployment of OSS projects is a crucial step in realizing their benefits and enabling users to leverage their capabilities effectively. @2023StateOpen

Deploying open-source software involves delivering and installing software solutions in an operational environment where they can be executed and utilized. This process includes activities such as configuration, provisioning, orchestration, scaling, and management. Unlike proprietary software, OSS deployment benefits from a collaborative community that contributes to its development, testing, and optimization. However, this advantage also presents unique challenges due to the diverse nature of OSS projects, their dependencies, and the need for specialized knowledge to deploy them efficiently.

Open-source software has been transformative, providing an array of tools and resources for building reliable systems. OSS projects are driven by community collaboration, which accelerates development and innovation. However, the diversity and complexity of these projects can pose significant challenges for deployment, as observed in Project 2 @lauberProjectOneClickDeployment2024.

== Current Technologies and Tools

Several technologies and tools facilitate OSS deployment, each addressing different aspects of the deployment lifecycle. Some of the key technologies and tools include:

- *Containerization Platforms (e.g., Docker #footnote[https://docker.com]):* These platforms package software, libraries, and dependencies in containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- *Orchestration Tools (e.g., Kubernetes #footnote[https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/]):* Orchestration tools manage the deployment, scaling, and networking of containers, supporting complex, scalable applications.
- *Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools (e.g. GitLab CI #footnote[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/]):* CI/CD tools automate the testing and deployment of software, enabling rapid iteration and deployment.
- *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools (e.g. Terraform #footnote[https://www.terraform.io/], Ansible #footnote[https://www.ansible.com/]):* IaC tools automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure through code, improving deployment speed and consistency.
- *Platform as a Service (PaaS) Providers (e.g. Vercel #footnote[https://vercel.com/], Heroku #footnote[https://www.heroku.com/], OpenShift #footnote[https://www.redhat.com/de/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift]):* PaaS providers offer cloud-based platforms that simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications. These platforms abstract infrastructure complexities, allowing developers to focus on building applications. The trade-off is being locked into the provider's ecosystem and potentially higher costs in the long run. @mikeramirezAttentionVercelUsers2023 @silberlingSocialAppCreatives2024
- *SaaS Hosting Providers (e.g. Bonsai Hosting #footnote[https://bonsai.io/], Kaa Node-Red Hosting #footnote[https://www.kaaiot.com/products/nodered-hosting-plan], Plural.sh #footnote[https://plural.sh], Streamlit Cloud #footnote[https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-community-cloud/deploy-your-app]):* SaaS hosting providers offer managed hosting services for specific OSS projects, simplifying deployment and management. These providers often offer additional features such as monitoring, scaling, and security. But they can be expensive and may limit customization options. @lauberProjectOneClickDeployment2024

These technologies collectively streamline the deployment process but also introduce their own complexities. While OSS tools offer flexibility and customization, they often require significant technical expertise to manage effectively. @nairPopularOSSTools2020

== Challenges in OSS Deployment

Despite advancements in deployment technologies, several challenges persist in OSS deployment:

- *Complexity:* OSS projects often involve complex dependencies and configurations, requiring specialized knowledge and significant effort to deploy and manage effectively. The learning curve for tools like Kubernetes can be steep, limiting accessibility. @mccartyKubernetesDumpTruck @cooneyBrutalLearningCurve2022 @PlatinaSystemsChallenges
- *Scalability:* Ensuring that OSS deployments can scale in response to demand without manual intervention is a significant challenge, particularly for organizations with limited resources. Managing horizontal and vertical scaling can be complex and time-consuming without automation. @cooneyBrutalLearningCurve2022
- *Security:* The open nature of OSS necessitates vigilant security practices to manage vulnerabilities and updates, protecting against breaches and compliance issues.
- *Integration:* Integrating OSS into existing systems or with other OSS projects can be complicated by compatibility issues, requiring extensive customization and testing. This can lead to deployment delays and operational challenges. @PlatinaSystemsChallenges
- *Community Support Variability:* While OSS benefits from community support, the level and quality of support can vary greatly between projects, affecting the reliability of deployment and maintenance efforts. Projects with limited community engagement may lack essential documentation, updates, or support channels.

These challenges highlight the need for solutions that can simplify and streamline OSS deployment, making it accessible to a broader range of users.

== Gaps in Existing Solutions

A review of current technologies and challenges reveals several gaps in the OSS deployment ecosystem that the One-Click Deployment system aims to address.

=== Simplification and Accessibility
There is a need for solutions that can simplify the deployment process, making it accessible to users without deep technical expertise in containerization, orchestration, or infrastructure management. Current tools often require a steep learning curve and significant manual intervention.
  - *Example*: Tools like Docker and Kubernetes are powerful but complex. Docker Compose can simplify multi-container applications but lacks advanced orchestration capabilities. Kubernetes provides extensive features but requires managing numerous YAML configuration files, which can be overwhelming for new users. @mccartyKubernetesDumpTruck @cooneyBrutalLearningCurve2022

=== Unified Deployment Solution
Current tools often address specific aspects of the deployment lifecycle, leading to the need for a unified solution that can manage the end-to-end deployment process cohesively.
  - *Example*: Each tool in the deployment pipeline (e.g., CI/CD, containerization, orchestration) requires separate configurations and management, leading to fragmentation and complexity. 

=== Customization vs. Standardization
Striking a balance between supporting customization and maintaining standard deployment practices is a persistent gap. Solutions must be flexible enough to accommodate the unique needs of different OSS projects while providing a standardized approach to simplify deployment.
  - *Example*: Customizing deployments for specific requirements can lead to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. Standardizing deployment practices can simplify management but may limit flexibility.

=== Security and Compliance
Enhanced tools for automating security checks, updates, and compliance validations within the deployment process are needed to address the evolving threat landscape and regulatory requirements.
  - *Example*: Ensuring that OSS deployments are secure and compliant with industry standards and regulations is a critical concern. Automated security scans, vulnerability assessments, and compliance checks can help mitigate risks.

*Proposed Solution: One-Click Deployment System* \
The One-Click Deployment system is proposed as a solution to these gaps, aiming to simplify the deployment process, enhance accessibility, and provide a unified, secure, and compliant deployment platform for OSS projects. By addressing these identified gaps, the system seeks to support broader adoption and more efficient utilization of OSS.
