= Methodology
This chapter outlines the methodology employed in the development of the One-Click Deployment system, focusing on the research design, development approach, and the tools and technologies utilized. This comprehensive methodology ensures a systematic and efficient approach to addressing the challenges and gaps identified in OSS deployment.

== Research Design
The research design adopted for this study is a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of the OSS deployment landscape and to evaluate the effectiveness of the One-Click Deployment system.
- *Literature Review*: An extensive review of existing literature on OSS deployment challenges, technologies, and tools was conducted. This helped identify the gaps in the current ecosystem and establish a theoretical foundation for the project.
- *Case Studies*: Multiple OSS projects were selected as case studies to understand the real-world challenges in deployment. These case studies involved detailed analysis of deployment processes, challenges faced, and the solutions adopted.
- *Surveys and Interviews*: Surveys and interviews with OSS developers, DevOps professionals, and organizations were conducted to gather insights into their deployment experiences, preferences, and the perceived challenges.
- *Prototype Evaluation*: The One-Click Deployment system prototype was evaluated through user testing sessions. Feedback was collected from users to assess usability, effectiveness, and overall satisfaction.

== Development Approach
The development of the One-Click Deployment system followed an iterative and agile methodology, emphasizing continuous integration, testing, and feedback to ensure adaptability and responsiveness to user needs.
- *Requirement Analysis*: Initial requirements were gathered based on the literature review, case studies, and survey results. These requirements guided the design and development of the system.
- *Prototype Development*: A minimum viable product (MVP) was developed to demonstrate the core functionality of the One-Click Deployment system. This MVP served as a basis for initial user testing and feedback.
- *Iterative Development and Testing*: Based on the feedback and additional research findings, the system underwent several iterations of development and testing. Each iteration focused on refining features, improving usability, and integrating additional functionalities.
- *User-Centered Design*: Throughout the development process, a user-centered design approach was adopted to ensure that the system met the needs and expectations of its intended users. This involved regular user testing sessions and feedback loops to guide design decisions.

== Tools and Technologies Used
The development of the One-Click Deployment system utilized a range of tools and technologies, selected for their efficiency, robustness, and compatibility with OSS deployment requirements.
- *Kubernetes*: As the backbone of the system, Kubernetes was used for orchestrating container deployment, scaling, and management.
- *Docker*: Docker was employed for containerizing applications, ensuring consistency across different deployment environments.
- *Operator SDK*: The Operator SDK facilitated the development of the Kubernetes operator, a key component of the system that automates the deployment and management processes.
- *Svelte and Pocketbase*: The frontend of the system was developed using Svelte, a modern framework for building web applications, while Pocketbase served as the backend database and API server.
- *Git and GitHub*: Git was used for version control, with GitHub hosting the project's code repository and facilitating collaboration among developers.
- *CI/CD Tools*: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment were achieved using tools like GitHub Actions, automating the testing and deployment of code changes.
By leveraging these tools and technologies, the One-Click Deployment system aims to provide a simplified, efficient, and scalable solution for OSS deployment, addressing the identified challenges and gaps in the current ecosystem.
