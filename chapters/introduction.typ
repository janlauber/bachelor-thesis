= Introduction
The increasing complexity and essential nature of open-source software (OSS) in the modern technology landscape have highlighted the need for simplified deployment and management solutions. Amidst a myriad of frameworks and applications, developers and organizations face significant challenges in deploying, managing, and scaling OSS. This thesis introduces a novel One-Click Deployment system designed to address these challenges, leveraging the power of Kubernetes and cutting-edge development practices to offer a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly deployment experience.

== Background and Context
Open-source software has become a cornerstone of innovation, offering a wealth of resources for building complex and reliable systems. However, the deployment and management of OSS remain daunting tasks for many, often requiring specialized knowledge and significant effort. The One-Click Deployment project emerges in response to this, aiming to democratize access to OSS by simplifying its deployment and management, thus fostering broader adoption and innovation.

== Problem Statement
The deployment and ongoing management of OSS are fraught with complexities, from setting up environments and dependencies to ensuring secure, scalable, and efficient operation. These challenges can deter the use of OSS, especially among smaller organizations and individual developers who may lack the resources for intricate deployment strategies. This thesis identifies and addresses these barriers, proposing a solution that encapsulates the complexity of deployment and management processes.

== Objectives of the Study
The primary objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate the One-Click Deployment system, focusing on:
- Simplifying the deployment process of OSS to a single click, regardless of the underlying technologies.
- Enabling seamless management and scaling of OSS deployments within a Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Assessing the impact of the One-Click Deployment system on the adoption and utilization of OSS.
- Contributing to the body of knowledge on OSS deployment and management best practices.

== Thesis Structure

This thesis is structured as follows:
- *Chapter 1: Introduction* - Sets the stage by outlining the context, challenges, and objectives.
