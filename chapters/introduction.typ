= Introduction
Deploying and managing open-source software (OSS) has become increasingly complex, especially with the rise of Kubernetes, a powerful but often challenging tool for container orchestration. This thesis introduces the One-Click Deployment system, designed to make Kubernetes more accessible and straightforward for users of all technical backgrounds.

== Background and Context
Open-source software is a cornerstone of modern technology, driving innovation and providing essential tools for building robust systems. However, the complexity of deploying and managing these tools can be a significant barrier, particularly with Kubernetes. While Kubernetes offers powerful features for container management, its steep learning curve can be intimidating. The One-Click Deployment project aims to democratize Kubernetes by simplifying its deployment and management processes, making these advanced capabilities available to everyone, from beginners to experienced developers.

== Problem Statement
The deployment and management of OSS using Kubernetes involve numerous challenges, such as setting up environments, managing dependencies, and ensuring security and scalability. These tasks often require specialized knowledge, which can limit the use of Kubernetes to larger organizations with dedicated resources. Smaller teams and individual developers may find these complexities overwhelming, hindering their ability to leverage the full potential of Kubernetes. This thesis addresses these barriers by presenting a solution that simplifies the deployment and management processes.

== Objectives of the Study
The main objectives of this study are to design, develop, and evaluate the One-Click Deployment system, focusing on:
- Simplifying the Kubernetes deployment process to a single click, making it accessible to users regardless of their technical expertise.
- Enabling easy management and scaling of OSS deployments within a Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Assessing the impact of the One-Click Deployment system on the adoption and utilization of Kubernetes.
- Collecting feedback from users to refine and enhance the system's features continuously.
- Identifying opportunities for future research and development in Kubernetes deployment and management.
